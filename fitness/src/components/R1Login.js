// I'll let you build out this form for logging in, you'll need a local state (probably just a name and password). Set that up and build an empty handle submit function, I'll finsh it out or I can show you what we'll do for it since it involves authentication (more than likely I'll just handle it solo as it's part of React 2 specifically)

    return ( 
        <form>
           <header><h1>Login</h1></header>

           </div>
        </form>
